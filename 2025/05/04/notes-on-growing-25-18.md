# Notes on Growing 25/18

> 🎯 ***Dip into Reinforcement Learning***

## MON
+ Updated the Obsidian plugin  
    + Addressed the syncing issue  
    + Found some edge cases during sync, but chose not to fix (for now):  
        + **Case 1:** Title-only changes cause duplicates since they’re seen as new content  
        + **Case 2:** Moved files aren't tracked — they just stay in the system  
    + Adding fixes would complicate things — putting it on hold until I’m sure it’s worth the trade-off  
+ Updated and released [cli-llm](https://github.com/jgkym/cli-llm)  
    + First time sharing a codebase publicly  
    + Also shared in the DSPy Discord — nice milestone!  
+ ❓ Still wondering: do I really need a fully end-to-end setup?

## WED
+ Supercharged the PKM system  
    + Promoted grounded notes to active recall with Anki  
    + Leveraging FSRS for smarter spaced repetition  
    + Built a hierarchical note-taking flow:  
        + **Literature (long)** → **Rephrased (medium)** → **My own words (short)**  
    + ❓ Noticed a strong reliance on LLMs — need to develop muscle to think independently  
    + Considering building my own wiki
+ Prompting for OCR  
    + Surprisingly, ChatGPT (via subscription) handles OCR pretty well  
    + Struggles with block math and irregular layouts though  
        + Fixed this by breaking instructions into smaller, bite-sized prompts  
    + Also updated some prompts to streamline note-taking

## THU
+ Jumped into DPO  
    + Reviewed some heavy math  
        + Change of variables  
        + Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

---

## FRI
+ Continued with the math foundations for DPO  
    + Information theory refresher  
    + Revisiting some topics — feels new, even if I’ve seen them before

---

## Recap  
👏 Published a repo to the community — first step into sharing, and it felt great. More apps coming.  
🔧 Post-launch was a bit hazy — felt lost and inefficient. Need a more practical, focused way forward.
