# Notes on Growing 25/15

> 🎯 ***Just ship some AI stuff. Learn by doing.***

## MON
+ Dipped into deployment by publishing a simple webpage  
+ Realized I need a better handle on GitHub Actions & workflows  
+ Started poking around FastAPI—kinda stuck on the whole API thing.  
    + REST? OpenAPI? Still a bit fuzzy.

---

## TUE
+ Built a tiny RAG from scratch in pure Python  
    + Tried to piece together the concepts behind RAG and fine-tuning  
+ Switched from `pixi` to `uv` — super smooth.  
    + Loving how Python-focused and easy to pick up it is.

---

## WED
+ 📚 Just read. A lot. Mostly about prompt engineering and how to write better prompts.  

---

## THU
+ Got some starter code from ChatGPT for a mini LLM app (Streamlit + FastAPI)  
    + Learn-by-doing is *crazy* effective with ChatGPT around  
        + 10 mins of chatting > 2 hours of reading docs  
    + Wondering:
        + Should I preload the model on startup for lower latency?
        + How do I handle chat history per user?
+ `uv` still winning over `pixi` in my exp  
    + Haven’t hit a single dependency headache since switching

---

## SUN
+ [Tiny LLM app](https://github.com/jgkym/tiny-llm-app/issues/1) is up and running 🚀  
    + Huge step in wrapping my head around app production  
    + Deployed with `ngrok`, but now curious about going deeper:  
        + Kubernetes? Cloud hosting? Let’s go.

## Recap  
👏 Took the first real steps in learning by doing  
🔧 Still reading a bit too much—need to turn more of that into action
