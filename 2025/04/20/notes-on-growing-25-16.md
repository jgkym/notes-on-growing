# Notes on Growing 25/16

> 🎯 ***Make [the tiny LLM app](https://github.com/jgkym/tiny-llm-app/issues/1) a bit more usable & pull Anki flashcards from Obsidian notes via MCP***

## MON
+ Tried to get into MCP  
    + Read through the official docs  
    + Still trying to wrap my head around the basics—sever? client? host?

---

## WED
+ Dug into fine-tuning and quantization  
    + Feels like I kinda fell off track  
    + Time to re-align with the original goal for this week

---

## THU
+ Paused further deployment work on the tiny LLM app  
    + Why? Got overwhelmed by network stuff like SSL, port forwarding, all that jazz
        + Took a breather before falling too deep down the rabbit hole
    + Shifted gears to focus more on MCP dev  

---

## FRI
+ Wrote the base code for fine-tuning  
    + Vanilla LoRA + HF PEFT  

---

## SAT
+ Watched a YouTube Short with a hilarious API analogy  
    + Would be fun to turn what I’ve learned into a short story or sketch  

---

## Recap  
❓ Still fuzzy on the whole network side of things. Not diving deep yet—just want the big picture for now  
👏 Some strong ideation energy this week (MCP + Anki + Obsidian = 🔥). Even got a few workouts in  
🔧 Drifted off goal a bit—felt scattered. Need to lock in and focus on one thing at a time.
